VDIO Requirements Document
1. Reconn Scope
Current Process

Source: An email is received from John Doe containing the DTR (Data Transmission Registration) for the current month.
Manual Steps:
The DTR file is manually reviewed.
Details are extracted into an Excel sheet, which is potentially used as a reference for a master sheet.


Objective: Determine if the Excel sheet can serve as a reference for the master sheet and explore automation opportunities.

Scope of Automation

File Upload on VDIO: Automate the process of uploading the DTR file to the VDIO system.
Scanning and Extraction:
Implement a scanning mechanism (similar to the existing Scan (C) process) to identify sensitive data in the DTR, such as:
NPI (Non-Public Information)
MNPI (Material Non-Public Information)
HRCI (Highly Restricted Confidential Information)
Confidential or Proprietary Data


Extract relevant details from the DTR and store them in a database.


Master Sheet Reference:
Analyze the Excel sheet generated from the DTR to determine if it can be used as a reference for the master tracker.
If feasible, integrate the extracted data into the master tracker database directly, eliminating the need for manual Excel handling.



Proposed Solution

Upload Mechanism: Develop a feature in VDIO to allow users to upload DTR files via a web interface.
Automated Scanning:
Use a script to scan the DTR file for sensitive data types (NPI, MNPI, HRCI, etc.).
Extract key fields (e.g., transmission details, vendor info) and store them in a structured database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).


Database Integration:
Map the extracted data to the master tracker database schema.
Validate the Excel sheet's structure to confirm its suitability as a reference for the master tracker.


Outcome: The DTR data will be directly integrated into the VDIO system, reducing manual effort and enabling seamless tracking.


2. Master Tracker Automation
Current Process

Manual Creation: Tom manually creates the Master Tracker in Excel, which contains numerous columns and is updated with data from multiple sources:
APPHQ
POP UI
Flagscape


Rise Deliverable:
A SharePoint form (Rise Deliverable) is created manually based on the Master Tracker.
The form is sent to users, who provide updates.
The status updates are manually entered back into the Excel sheet.



Scope of Automation

Eliminate Excel Dependency:
Replace the Excel-based Master Tracker with a web-based UI for tracking DTRs.


Automate Rise Deliverable:
Convert the SharePoint form (Rise Deliverable) into an Angular-based web application.
Allow users to update details directly through the new Angular site.


Centralized Tracking:
Store all DTR-related data in a database.
Integrate data from sources (APPHQ, POP UI, Flagscape) into the new UI for real-time updates.



Proposed Solution

Web-Based UI:
Develop a new Angular application to replace the Excel-based Master Tracker.
Features:
Display DTR details in a tabular format.
Allow filtering, sorting, and searching of DTR records.
Integrate with a backend database to store and retrieve DTR data.




Automated Data Integration:
Create APIs to pull data from APPHQ, POP UI, and Flagscape into the VDIO database.
Schedule automated updates to ensure the UI reflects the latest data.


Rise Deliverable Automation:
Migrate the SharePoint form to an Angular-based form within the new UI.
Features:
Users can log in to the Angular site to view and update their assigned DTRs.
Automated notifications (e.g., email) to users when a new Rise Deliverable is assigned.
Status updates are saved directly to the database, eliminating manual Excel updates.




Outcome:
A fully automated, web-based system for tracking DTRs.
Improved efficiency by removing manual Excel and SharePoint processes.
Enhanced user experience with a modern Angular interface.




Next Steps

Technical Feasibility: Assess the integration capabilities with APPHQ, POP UI, and Flagscape.
Database Design: Define the schema for storing DTR and Master Tracker data.
UI/UX Design: Create wireframes for the Angular application.
Stakeholder Review: Validate the proposed automation scope with John Doe, Tom, and other stakeholders.
